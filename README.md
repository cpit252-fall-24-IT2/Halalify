# Halalify: Automated Video Profanity Filter
Halalify is an innovative app that uses the IBM API to transcribe audio from videos into text. It then compares the transcribed text to a customizable list of bad words and automatically censors them, ensuring a cleaner, family-friendly viewing experience.

#Disclosure:
My teammate Ahmed and I dedicated hours of time and effort to develop this application. While we leveraged AI tools like ChatGPT to assist with code generation, the core ideas, problem-solving, and careful refinement of the app were driven by our collaboration and commitment to building a functional, well-designed product.
