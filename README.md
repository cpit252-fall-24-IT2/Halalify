# Halalify: Automated Video Profanity Filter
Halalify is an innovative app designed to automatically detect and censor offensive language in videos. It processes video content, identifies bad words through advanced speech recognition and text analysis, and outputs the same video with these words muted or replaced by bleeps, providing a seamless and family-friendly viewing experience.

#Disclosure:
My teammate Ahmed and I dedicated hours of time and effort to develop this application. While we leveraged AI tools like ChatGPT to assist with code generation, the core ideas, problem-solving, and careful refinement of the app were driven by our collaboration and commitment to building a functional, well-designed product.
